Hi Alex,

I have decided to use our new Password Manager Web Server to store your password, since you have access to my SSH key and need to be more secure.
The web server is running locally (IP address 127.0.0.1) on this machine on port 1337 and requires sending the following password in a POST request.

Password: imjustgonnawhackmykeyboardforabitR3DSAV76ydwsqa8hb7HD

Unfortunately the web server is not ready to be exposed to the internet, so the easiest way would be to use either curl or wget.

Once again, BE CAREFUL WITH THOSE CREDENTIALS! If someone gets access to my account they could hack the entire server since I can use sudo for certain commands!

Regards,

David
