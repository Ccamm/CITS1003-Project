Hi Jeff,

Due to a recent security breach, I have reset your password to one that is far more secure than just "jeff"...
David is currently building a password manager that we can use, but for now you can find your new credentials in that secret folder I told you about the other day in a file called "jeffs_creds.txt".

Kind Regards,
Admin Alex
