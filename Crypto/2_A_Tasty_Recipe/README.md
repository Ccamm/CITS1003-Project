# Challenge

**Name:** A Tasty Recipe

**Category:** Cryptography

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Description:**

My friend told me that they have *cooked up* a new secure cipher by combining multiple weaker ciphers together. Can you crack their code and retrieve the plain text from the message? You'll need to bruteforce a key at one point, but it is only 1 byte long.
